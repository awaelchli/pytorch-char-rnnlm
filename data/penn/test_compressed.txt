 time 's <unk> <unk> washington <unk> co. 's <unk> and u.s. news & world report are less <unk> on <unk> <unk> and in recent years both have been increasing their <unk> rate <unk> 
 both <unk> are expected to <unk> their ad rates and <unk> levels for N within a month 
 when the news <unk> of an <unk> <unk> in <unk> two weeks ago sen. <unk> <unk> called the state department for a <unk> 
 they said <unk> <unk> he told <unk> 
 that <unk> how far <unk> <unk> 's <unk> news network has come since its <unk> nine years ago when it was considered the <unk> of television news 
 it is <unk> <unk> and more <unk> than the news <unk> of any of the three major <unk> <unk> 
 its <unk> as the network of record during major <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world 
 but for all its <unk> <unk> has hit a <unk> 
 although <unk> <unk> when big news <unk> it <unk> during <unk> of <unk> 
 <unk> executives <unk> that the network 's <unk> but <unk> news <unk> may be getting <unk> and wo n't keep <unk> coming back as the <unk> <unk> for news and information on <unk> 
 just the fact we 're on N hours is no longer <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> 's executive vice president news <unk> and no <unk> to <unk> <unk> 
 you ca n't <unk> on that 
 so <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> system inc. is trying to <unk> itself as a <unk> <unk> or what people in the television industry call a top of <unk> network 
 <unk> to <unk> off the effort <unk> will <unk> its first <unk> <unk> in years an <unk> show at N <unk> eastern time to air <unk> against the network <unk> 
 the show will be <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> a <unk> former texas judge and <unk> <unk> <unk> who has never held a job in television or <unk> 
 the new show is perhaps the <unk> in a number of <unk> the network is taking to build <unk> <unk> by <unk> away from its current <unk> toward more <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> 
 to <unk> itself <unk> is also <unk> international <unk> and <unk> a second <unk> program 
 it is <unk> higher <unk> after years of <unk> to <unk> and keep <unk> <unk> 
 and it is <unk> on an <unk> <unk> to <unk> major <unk> with a large <unk> team 
 the next <unk> is to get <unk> the <unk> leaders who use us as a point of <unk> to become a point of <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> executive vice president of <unk> news <unk> 's <unk> network 
 but that wo n't be <unk> 
 <unk> like other consumer products <unk> <unk> in <unk> ' <unk> that are n't <unk> to change 
 it also <unk> money that <unk> has been <unk> to <unk> to make programs and <unk> <unk> that <unk> will <unk> in <unk> to see 
 and the <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> and part <unk> like things just the way they are 
 the <unk> bid is <unk> at <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and what may <unk> to it as the <unk> news market <unk> more <unk> 
 already <unk> is <unk> <unk> competition from financial news network inc. and general electric co. 's consumer news and business <unk> both of which are likely to <unk> more general news in the future 
 in addition many <unk> systems themselves are <unk> more local and <unk> news programs <unk> by local <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> wants to change its <unk> ' <unk> 
 its <unk> are on the <unk> a <unk> group of <unk> <unk> and news <unk> who <unk> an average of just N <unk> a day <unk> <unk> according to <unk> research 
 that 's less than <unk> the time that <unk> <unk> the major <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> <unk> give <unk> could put it at a <unk> as <unk> data and advertising become more important to <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> 's <unk> <unk> have been <unk> by its <unk> 
 its strategy in the past has been to <unk> as a tv <unk> service 
 it <unk> on building up its news <unk> around the world so as <unk> took place it could go <unk> <unk> and longer than other <unk> 
 it <unk> its daily <unk> with <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but the <unk> <unk> little in <unk> <unk> or look 
 now the <unk> is on for <unk> <unk> 
 our <unk> is to <unk> more programs with an individual <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president for <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> is <unk> a <unk> show in the <unk> because <unk> show its <unk> <unk> in the <unk> is among its most <unk> programs in <unk> ' <unk> says mr. <unk> 
 and it is <unk> other <unk> programs similar to its <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> which executives <unk> will keep people <unk> in 
 then there 's the world today the <unk> <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> and ms. <unk> 
 until now <unk> has <unk> its <unk> <unk> show during the key <unk> period 
 but N N of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> news do so between N p.m. and N p.m. the network <unk> so <unk> wants in 
 mr. <unk> says the <unk> team will probably do two <unk> <unk> a day with most of the program at least for now <unk> similar to <unk> 's other <unk> 
 some in the industry are <unk> 
 i find it hard to <unk> of people <unk> over to <unk> for what at least in the public 's <unk> is the same news says <unk> <unk> the former <unk> president of <unk> news and <unk> of the <unk> report

 <unk> executives <unk> the <unk> <unk> by such <unk> will <unk> <unk> for its <unk> programs in the way N <unk> did so well for <unk> 
 that 's such a <unk> from the past that many in the industry are <unk> <unk> will <unk> through with its <unk> <unk> especially after it <unk> the cost of <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 they 've never <unk> any <unk> to <unk> money on production says michael <unk> a senior <unk> with <unk> <unk> who notes that <unk> is <unk> to his job

 says mr. <unk> <unk> is my <unk> service they 're on top of <unk> 
 but to <unk> they 've really got to make the investment in people 
 in any case <unk> <unk> have reason to <unk> any <unk> with <unk> 's <unk>

 the <unk> that make <unk> <unk> are really being <unk> by <unk> machines said mr. <unk> 
 as a result of this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ibm and <unk> equipment corp. are <unk> to <unk> with <unk> systems of their own

 <unk> is making a <unk> 
 so are <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 the <unk> of all four states is on the <unk> according to new <unk> <unk> estimates following <unk> <unk> the early <unk> 
 the gains to be <unk> are rather small 
 <unk> for <unk> <unk> its <unk> <unk> by N people or N N between N and N the <unk> <unk> says 
 still even that <unk> increase is good news for a state that had n't <unk> at all since N 
 between N and N north <unk> was the only state in the <unk> to <unk> <unk> a loss of N people 
 six of the N <unk> states have been growing <unk> since N <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> south <unk> and <unk> 
 the <unk> has been holding its own in the <unk> <unk> 
 seven of nine states have <unk> each year since N including new york which lost N N of its <unk> during the <unk>

 this does n't <unk> they 're less likely to <unk> <unk> however 
 that share has <unk> at about N N since N 
 what has changed is that more of the young <unk> are <unk> with <unk> rather than with other <unk> such as <unk> 
 in N N N of those <unk> N to N <unk> with <unk> other than <unk> down from N N in N 
 as people get even <unk> many become <unk> 
 but even among those <unk> N and <unk> the share <unk> with a <unk> rose slightly to N N in N from N N in N 
 like their <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> are less likely to <unk> with other <unk> 
 only N N of those <unk> N and <unk> <unk> with <unk> other than <unk> in N down from N N in N

 more people are <unk> independent longer <unk> because they are better off <unk> and <unk>

 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would be <unk> 
 it would open a can of <unk> 
 <unk> is no <unk> to <unk> of <unk> either 
 after its previous <unk> <unk> <unk> last year an <unk> disclosed that <unk> officials <unk> <unk> on their own projects <unk> special <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> into the <unk> 's <unk> for <unk> and <unk>

 now <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
 i think there 's some people <unk> about something <unk> <unk> <unk> john <unk> says 
 i thought this was all taken care of in the <unk> man 
 the only thing robert <unk> could <unk> about <unk> 's new show <unk> <unk> <unk> & <unk> sept. N was the local <unk> <unk> <unk> he <unk> the producers of the show have done their <unk> 
 for <unk> <unk> white is not the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is 
 richard <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> up its long <unk> 
 and the local <unk> for <unk> is <unk> not <unk> 
 and even if a <unk> would <unk> <unk> in her <unk> while on <unk> if she were <unk> she would know to <unk> them <unk> her left not right <unk> 
 <unk> the show does not even have the one <unk> <unk> of <unk> local <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> 
 of all the <unk> <unk> in america which is the most <unk> right now 
 a good <unk> would be the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> in new york city 
 or so it must <unk> to <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> <unk> on tuesday <unk> N p.m. <unk> 
 not only is mr. <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> he 's also the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> back to <unk> <unk> and he 's currently a man in <unk> <unk> 
 here in <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of mr. <unk> 's <unk> <unk> first in the <unk> <unk> while he was a paid spokesman for the <unk> <unk> <unk> campaign and then in <unk> after he and the campaign <unk> company 
 mr. <unk> said that many <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> toward <unk> so they support black <unk> <unk> 
 he said that many black <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> so they too support black <unk> <unk> 
 he said that <unk> have <unk> more to black <unk> over the years than vice <unk> 
 of course mr. <unk> did not use <unk> <unk> 
 as a <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the old days on the <unk> <unk> <unk> television and the <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> <unk> reached for the <unk> 
 he said <unk> were <unk> with <unk> and he called david <unk> mr. <unk> 's black <unk> a <unk> <unk> with a <unk> 
 if mr. <unk> had used less <unk> <unk> to <unk> his <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of his <unk> new <unk> would the <unk> be <unk> so <unk> 
 it probably would because few or <unk> of the people <unk> by mr. <unk> 's <unk> have <unk> to <unk> between the <unk> of his <unk> and the fact that he used <unk> <unk> 
 in addition some of mr. <unk> 's <unk> have <unk> that his <unk> of <unk> <unk> is itself a form of <unk> 
 for example the new york state <unk> for the <unk> said that mr. <unk> is like a <unk> 
 people are <unk> <unk> the place where he is <unk> 
 these <unk> <unk> to <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> at <unk> another group such as <unk> <unk> and the <unk> that is <unk> <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> and it was <unk> by both <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> <unk> as a means of <unk> their white and <unk> <unk> along with themselves 
 in the <unk> of a <unk> like <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> could cut both the <unk> and the <unk> to <unk> 
 but <unk> by a <unk> like <unk> <unk> it is a <unk> form of <unk> 
 why <unk> 
 because despite all the <unk> <unk> about <unk> and <unk> not <unk> they are similar in one <unk> both can <unk> as <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of groups in <unk> 
 that 's why it 's <unk> to have <unk> thought <unk> on <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> of group <unk> 
 as <unk> <unk> <unk> in the new york times just before the <unk> <unk> perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with such <unk> if <unk> <unk> were <unk> to <unk> 
 the question is if group <unk> still <unk> as <unk> they do and if mr. <unk> 's <unk> of <unk> <unk> is <unk> then what other means do we have for <unk> off <unk> 
 do n't say the tv <unk> because that <unk> to be a <unk> that in its <unk> need to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> more than it does <unk> 
 it is <unk> that the best <unk> do allow group <unk> to <unk> <unk> vs. <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> vs. <unk> in the <unk> show 
 but these are not the <unk> that make <unk> 
 in <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> and <unk> of three against the <unk> of his <unk> <unk> <unk> and her <unk> michael <unk> <unk> 
 it 's worth <unk> that both <unk> <unk> are <unk> 
 at least they both <unk> with strong <unk> as do <unk> and <unk> 
 it could n't be more <unk> that <unk> <unk> is being made from an old <unk> 
 and a <unk> one <unk> if the <unk> in question were between an <unk> <unk> and a <unk> of the nation of <unk> 
 back in the <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> 's <unk> rose made the <unk> of <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> so <unk> that its <unk> <unk> <unk> lost a <unk> suit on the <unk> that the <unk> has <unk> the public <unk> 
 and it has <unk> there as <unk> by its <unk> in a N <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> <unk> was that it led to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and david <unk> 
 <unk> the question with <unk> <unk> is not whether the <unk> will <unk> over but whether it will <unk> at all 
 so far the <unk> have been few and far between 
 part of the problem is the <unk> of all <unk> ever since the <unk> days of <unk> <unk> to <unk> about <unk> issues 
 to some <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> the show <unk> to <unk> us about <unk> <unk> by <unk> them 
 for <unk> michael <unk> <unk> not because he 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> but because he <unk> his <unk> job as a <unk> in order to become a <unk> <unk>

 as your <unk> <unk> <unk> out <unk> <unk> former <unk> secretary and <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> 's former <unk> are currently being held up to <unk> for taking the <unk> <unk> 
 that <unk> is not the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by mr. <unk> 
 N that his committee does not deal with any possible <unk> activity at <unk> 
 my <unk> and i <unk> <unk> we are not a court <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> 
 by any <unk> man <unk> mr. <unk> and his <unk> have a <unk> <unk> of people <unk> and <unk> 
 <unk> their <unk> is in 
 right now they 're <unk> <unk> 
 that 's not a bad way to <unk> just <unk> different from standard american <unk> 
 how was that <unk> <unk> to when i was in school 
 <unk> <unk> something called a <unk> <unk> 
 of course mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> that his <unk> simply <unk> information for <unk> change 
 no <unk> that 's <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> that mr. <unk> says in his <unk> is <unk> <unk> 
 he 's right about his <unk> 's <unk> when it <unk> to <unk> information from <unk> <unk> officials 
 but if his <unk> of <unk> is <unk> why is his <unk> so <unk> as to <unk> <unk> activity 
 why not simply <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> 
 such as what <unk> when congress <unk> to know about $ N <unk> <unk> or <unk> they <unk> cost 
 no mr. <unk> 's <unk> simply wo n't <unk> 
 N that the journal <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the public that took place while mr. <unk> was secretary of <unk> etc. and so <unk> 
 no to my <unk> the journal did not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the public trust 
 it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> common <unk> 
 the problem which the journal so <unk> <unk> out in a number of <unk> is not the <unk> of mr. <unk> who after all is really a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> but the <unk> by congress to <unk> itself into a <unk> <unk> 
 of course we 've also got a <unk> that <unk> the same <unk> 
 the system is the problem not an individual <unk> 
 <unk> can always have their <unk> <unk> 
 it 's when such <unk> does n't <unk> that we 've got <unk> 
 i do not by any means <unk> <unk> management 
 but i think the kind of congressional <unk> that has been <unk> is a far <unk> <unk> to american <unk> of <unk> and <unk> than any <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> within <unk> could <unk> <unk> 
 the last time i <unk> a similar congressional <unk> was when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did his work 
 <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> 
 i <unk> with the statement by mr. <unk> that one should not <unk> an <unk> <unk> against former <unk> officials who <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> against <unk> in congressional <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> states in <unk> part that no <unk> <unk> be <unk> in any <unk> case to be a <unk> against <unk> 
 this <unk> against <unk> <unk> the <unk> of an <unk> <unk> against a <unk> <unk> who <unk> not to <unk> 
 <unk> in a <unk> case a <unk> can not comment on a <unk> 's <unk> to <unk> <unk> can the <unk> be <unk> to take the <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> him to take the <unk> 
 the <unk> however has been limited in <unk> with its <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> in <unk> <unk> only 
 the <unk> court and some states have <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> does not <unk> the <unk> where the <unk> is <unk> by a party to a <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> v. <unk> N u.s. N N 
 <unk> in a <unk> case a <unk> may be called as a <unk> he may be <unk> to <unk> or take the <unk> and his taking of the <unk> may <unk> the <unk> of an <unk> <unk> against him in the <unk> <unk> 
 he may take the <unk> in a <unk> <unk> only if he has a good <unk> and <unk> <unk> that his <unk> may subject him to <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> the <unk> to take the <unk> in a <unk> <unk> is not based on a <unk> right to <unk> to <unk> where one 's <unk> <unk> him in the <unk> <unk> but because the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> could be <unk> used against him in a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> the risk of such <unk> a court may order the <unk> to <unk> 
 <unk> when mr. <unk> <unk> the <unk> in a <unk> <unk> particularly after <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from legal <unk> one must <unk> that he held a <unk> <unk> <unk> that his <unk> could be used against him in a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> congress and the american public have every right to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and to <unk> with mr. <unk> 's own <unk> that his <unk> could help <unk> him of a <unk> 
 <unk> the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> congressional <unk> does not <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> against <unk> 
 <unk> s. <unk> <unk>

 <unk> computer corp. meanwhile has <unk> a much more <unk> <unk> that can run <unk> N and other <unk> software programs but costs five times as much 
 at stake is what <unk> <unk> <unk> 's president of north america operations calls the <unk> <unk> of the computer industry the <unk> for a real computer in a <unk> so small you can take it <unk> 
 the market is so new <unk> <unk> yet how big it can be 
 i 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is says <unk> <unk> director of marketing for <unk> 
 whether it 's $ N billion or $ N billion it does n't <unk> 
 it 's huge 
 consider the growth of <unk> which now <unk> N N of all personal computer sales 
 <unk> generally anything under N <unk> have become the <unk> personal computer <unk> with sales <unk> this year 
 <unk> to that demand however has led to a <unk> of <unk> 
 making computers <unk> often means <unk> <unk> 
 it also has <unk> use of the <unk> more <unk> <unk> found in increasing <unk> of <unk> machines 
 <unk> and <unk> <unk> also have limited <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> can get <unk> <unk> at times 
 a <unk> spokesman for example <unk> the <unk> portfolio because it <unk> three <unk> while the <unk> <unk> only two 
 both <unk> are <unk> by <unk> makers who <unk> that they 're too small a problem <unk> also <unk> in <unk> groups <unk> <unk> <unk> director of marketing 
 <unk> trying to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> line the <unk> <unk> a very big computer 
 despite the <unk> few question the <unk> of the move to small machines that do n't make <unk> 
 toward that end <unk> say the real <unk> will take place between <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and now <unk> 
 <unk> 's new machines are considered a <unk> <unk> to <unk> firms like <unk> inc. which <unk> in june a computer that like <unk> 's <unk> an <unk> N <unk> and has a hard <unk> <unk>

 adds bill <unk> senior industry analyst for <unk> a <unk> market research firm we <unk> think that these are very <unk> products 
 the problem <unk> is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them 
 <unk> 's machines include the N <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> that is only <unk> <unk> and an <unk> <unk> <unk> for a <unk> in other <unk> almost all the <unk> of a <unk> office <unk> 
 others <unk> will <unk> but most analysts believe <unk> has at least a <unk> lead on the competition 
 <unk> 's line of <unk> for example <unk> the <unk> which is in the same <unk> <unk> but is much <unk> and has less <unk> and the <unk> which also <unk> a N <unk> but which <unk> almost <unk> as much and is three times the <unk>

 it is back with us again in the form of legislation to pay <unk> under a national and community service act a proposal with a <unk> <unk> at congressional <unk> this fall 
 why does the <unk> <unk> keep coming back 
 perhaps it is because <unk> <unk> <unk> both military <unk> and the <unk> <unk> 
 if only we could get america 's <unk> <unk> into at least a <unk> <unk> we might be able to <unk> <unk> again and <unk> the <unk> of <unk> 
 a quarter of a <unk> ago national service was <unk> as a way of <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> by of all things <unk> the <unk>

 <unk> you most of the <unk> would be <unk> N to <unk> some not even high school <unk> and many <unk> money by <unk> at home 
 they would be doing better <unk> under national service than many <unk> working at the same <unk> of <unk> and perhaps <unk> <unk> 
 as it <unk> political <unk> <unk> among <unk> and <unk> interests that <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> system so the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of give in order to get 
 <unk> to national service from the <unk> which wants to <unk> its own <unk> process also led to the <unk> <unk> being dropped 
 <unk> a new <unk> for national service had to be <unk> up 
 what better place to turn than sen. <unk> <unk> 's labor committee that great <unk> of government <unk> where many a <unk> <unk> of <unk> is <unk> on the back <unk> until it can be <unk> <unk> and <unk> as <unk> <unk>

 according to the <unk> <unk> american <unk> <unk> an average of two hours a week of service while financial <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> have <unk> N N <unk> for inflation 
 even if government does see <unk> <unk> <unk> national service is not the way to meet them 
 if we want to support <unk> we might <unk> the <unk> used in other countries of offering more <unk> based on something called <unk> rather than on the government 's <unk> of service 
 or we might provide a tax credit for working <unk> 
 what we do not need to do is start a war and then try to <unk> it by <unk> a <unk> bill 
 to the <unk> we <unk> <unk> to staff <unk> <unk> in <unk> for example we should raise pay <unk> <unk> technology or allow more legal <unk> rather than <unk> high school <unk> as short-term workers and <unk> <unk> among <unk> workers paid <unk> <unk> to do the same <unk> 
 will national service in the current <unk> <unk> and <unk> form <unk> enough <unk> to get <unk>

 friday 's <unk> <unk> in stocks does not come <unk> the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> financial markets just <unk> to their N october <unk> and <unk> have been put in place to keep markets more <unk> 
 still the <unk> is about the same on friday the <unk> the market was <unk> by washington 
 the <unk> along the street seems to be that the <unk> was <unk> by the financing problems of the ual takeover and it 's <unk> <unk> the <unk> began <unk> after the ual trading <unk> 
 still the <unk> seems almost as <unk> that one <unk> bid is no reason to <unk> down the value of all u.s. business 
 this <unk> <unk> us to another <unk> of news <unk> on the dow jones <unk> <unk> before the <unk> the <unk> of senate <unk> in <unk> the capital gains tax cut 
 the real value of all shares after all is <unk> <unk> by the tax on any profits all the more so given the <unk> on <unk> for losses that show gains are not <unk> income 
 and market <unk> <unk> have been raised by the capital gains <unk> in the house last month 
 an <unk> before friday 's <unk> that <unk> was <unk> from the tax bill <unk> it with $ N billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut 
 there is a great deal to be said to be <unk> for <unk> the <unk> out of the <unk> bill 
 it would be a good thing if congress started to <unk> issues <unk> on their individual <unk> without <unk> 
 for one thing no one <unk> that the capital gains cut would <unk> on an <unk> vote 
 since senate leaders have so far <unk> it up with <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> bill are <unk> 
 especially so since president bush has been <unk> by the <unk> <unk> 
 to the <unk> that the ual <unk> <unk> to the <unk> they are another <unk> of washington 's <unk> <unk> 
 as the best <unk> for corporate <unk> are <unk> of course at some point the market will start to <unk> them 
 but the airlines are <unk> a clear case given <unk> <unk> by secretary of transportation <unk> who <unk> to believe <unk> will be <unk> if <unk> and british <unk> own interests in companies that <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> congress has started to <unk> on the <unk> <unk> 
 james <unk> the <unk> <unk> who <unk> the public <unk> and transportation committee 's <unk> <unk> has put an <unk> takeover bill on <unk> <unk> so that it would be <unk> in time to <unk> the american and united air lines <unk> 
 it would give mr. <unk> up to N days to <unk> any bid for N N or more of the <unk> stock of any u.s. <unk> with <unk> of $ N billion or more 
 so the ual deal has problems and the market <unk> N points 
 <unk> mr. secretary and mr. <unk> 
 in the N <unk> <unk> the market was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> proposal to tax <unk> out of <unk> 
 even more important in our view was the treasury 's <unk> to <unk> the dollar 
 the treasury is doing the same thing today <unk> the dollar is not under <unk> pressure 
 also traders are in better <unk> today than in N to <unk> selling <unk> 
 they are better <unk> 
 they are in less <unk> of <unk> <unk> simply because of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and settlement <unk> 
 the fed <unk> any needed <unk> 
 the big board 's <unk> with the chicago board of trade has <unk> it will be <unk> to <unk> if <unk> <unk> <unk> to be a good <unk> 
 in any <unk> some traders see stocks as <unk> today <unk> N 
 there is <unk> <unk> with the market that ca n't be <unk> by a little <unk> and common <unk> in washington 
 but on the <unk> <unk> that may be too much to expect

 interest income and most <unk> income was strong 
 <unk> 's second <unk> of general <unk> this year is <unk> for nov. N 
 for those <unk> to see a <unk> of political <unk> <unk> in view of <unk> 's <unk> <unk> under <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> government there is but one <unk> <unk> the <unk> still <unk> former prime <unk> <unk> <unk> and his <unk> <unk> government are like <unk> <unk> around a <unk> <unk> 
 in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> no clear <unk> to any <unk> political party 
 the ad <unk> <unk> government that <unk> from <unk> <unk> was in <unk> little more than the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> on one <unk> the <unk> new <unk> party <unk> by <unk> <unk> 
 on the other the <unk> <unk> of the left and <unk> a <unk> and rather <unk> <unk> for a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> party of <unk> and its <unk> <unk> the <unk> left 
 the <unk> bond for this <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> 's party as common political <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> of government <unk> <unk> at all levels but the <unk> marks were mr. <unk> and his <unk> <unk> 
 in point of fact this <unk> was <unk> by <unk> 
 when reduced to <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> however the <unk> <unk> into a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> for political gains not <unk> 
 with <unk> to <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> 's <unk> <unk> remains <unk> <unk> former <unk> of the bank of <unk> and <unk> <unk> now <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in <unk> mass. from where he is <unk> <unk> <unk> that would return him to <unk> 
 mr. <unk> 's <unk> is at best <unk> 
 he has <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and his <unk> has also been found less than <unk> on <unk> points 
 <unk> the new <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> as <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
 among <unk> <unk> are whether mr. <unk> received $ N million of <unk> bank of <unk> funds and an additional $ N in <unk> as <unk> whether the prime <unk> <unk> state <unk> to <unk> some $ N million in mr. <unk> 's bank and then <unk> off the interest and what <unk> 's cut was from the $ N million mr. <unk> <unk> 
 two former <unk> were so <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that <unk> members of <unk> <unk> to <unk> them to the special court 
 but <unk> <unk> <unk> was the case of <unk> of <unk> mr. <unk> <unk> into new <unk> <unk> 
 in the end the <unk> <unk> only <unk> <unk> and <unk> that point to <unk> not <unk> <unk> 
 on another issue <unk> were told how their national <unk> agency the <unk> <unk> <unk> the telephone <unk> of <unk> figures including key <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> members 
 despite <unk> <unk> it was never <unk> that mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> 
 the central <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> up especially well when <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 the <unk> government <unk> to show that <unk> <unk> had received <unk> <unk> for <unk> the purchase of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> N <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> general <unk> corp. and france 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> general <unk> <unk> <unk> could be expected to <unk> its <unk> future <unk> by making <unk> of <unk> paid or not to <unk> <unk> officials for services <unk> 
 so it seems that mr. <unk> and his <unk> <unk> may have <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> a <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> whether <unk> or not can now <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> at mr. <unk> 's <unk> 
 but while <unk> high <unk> <unk> wo n't help <unk> <unk> power mr. <unk> should never be <unk> 
 first came his <unk> <unk> he <unk> the <unk> of the left and <unk> had sold out its <unk> <unk> by <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> and <unk> the course of <unk> in <unk> 
 then to <unk> his <unk> with the left he <unk> some <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> for <unk> under the <unk> <unk> 
 next he continued to court the <unk> many of <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> 's <unk> by <unk> into <unk> a <unk> <unk> party <unk> 
 for <unk> and in <unk> of <unk> some <unk> <unk> <unk> he <unk> to <unk> a former new <unk> party <unk> and known political <unk> of mr. <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> not only with <unk> <unk> but also with <unk> of approval from <unk> of its <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> as these <unk> are for <unk> <unk> issues of state are getting lost in the <unk> 
 the country 's future <unk> <unk> remains <unk> for <unk> 
 <unk> also must <unk> major <unk> of legislation in <unk> for the N <unk> of <unk> common market <unk>

 for one the current <unk> <unk> u.s. military <unk> in <unk> <unk> in may N

 another <unk> of concern is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> who is <unk> in the u.s. for the N <unk> of a <unk> american <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> have <unk> in <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> case but the <unk> <unk> <unk> approval from <unk> 's next <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the case as a <unk> test of whether <unk> will be <unk> in or out for international efforts to <unk> <unk> 
 that <unk> could <unk> the <unk> <unk> is <unk> the <unk> press previously <unk> to <unk> off <unk> 's line has turned on mr. <unk> with a <unk> <unk> 
 yet the <unk> of another <unk> government is all too real 
 if mr. <unk> <unk> the major <unk> leader he could <unk> a <unk> <unk> 
 also he could force new <unk> early next year by <unk> the <unk> for the <unk> of the president of the <unk> in march 
 new <unk> has once again <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> its own <unk> to <unk> <unk> against <unk> <unk> to <unk> to either program <unk> or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
